# Description

I am re submitting this assignment as in the prior attempt I was not able to work thru all required functions. This time I have a better understanding of Javascript after near complition of training in back end. I was able to create all required functions to complete the acceptance criteria. Plus I was also able to do a lot better work with css to give the website a polished look. This was agreat experience to review front end Javascript, especially practicing local storage and css (without bootstrap)!
